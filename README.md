### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

At the moment I'm a high school student who writes code as a hobby.

I like to help people, if there is something you are stuck on, don't hesitate to contact me with mail.

I was once part of the Batch-Man organization (an organization that writes tools for developers to make it easier for them to write code). \
Not counting the languages I use occasionally, I started with C++, then I continued with C# and these months I have been writing javascript.

The ones I use when necessary: \
 - CSharp, Python, SQL, Javascript, BatchFile, Git, VS Community, Rider, VS Code, NodeJS, Postman.
