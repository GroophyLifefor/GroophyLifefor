## Before I was 18

- In March 2019 I started writing servers for the Growtopia game with C++
- - The fact that I spent a lot of time with VPSs helped me a lot in the future.
- - I also started developing performance-oriented servers from scratch due to the hundreds of players on the servers.
- It lasted until March 2021 and then I left C++ completely and started C#.
- - I have written dozens of NuGet libraries and it has more than 5k downloads
- - Apart from libraries with C#, I also tried to make a big IDE, it was very good years.
- In February 2023, I entered the Web world.
- - While learning web, I had an internship opportunity and I did my first internship at [Insider](https://useinsider.com/) for 2 months and actually to get internship, process took 6 months.
