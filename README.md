# Hi there üëã

## Before I was 18

- In March 2019 I started writing servers for the Growtopia game with C++
- - The fact that I spent a lot of time with VPSs helped me a lot in the future.
- - I also started developing performance-oriented servers from scratch due to the hundreds of players on the servers.
- It lasted until March 2021 and then I left C++ completely and started C#.
- - I have written dozens of NuGet libraries and it has more than 5k downloads
- - Apart from libraries with C#, I also tried to make a big IDE, it was very good years.
- In February 2023, I entered the Web world.
- - While learning web, I had an internship opportunity and I did my first internship at [Insider](https://useinsider.com/) for 2 months and actually to get internship, process took 6 month.
- - Then I was deemed eligible for the Success story with [Kodluyoruz](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/en) and [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/), I didn't think I was eligible at the time, but looking back at what I did today, I really deserved it. Here is the video [Click](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiRbxzKw-hY&t=1s)
- - I did a 2-month internship at [Collective Idea](https://www.collectiveidea.net/)
- - I did an internship at [Valentura](https://valentura.com/) for 7 months
- - I did an internship at [Peaker Soft](https://peakersoft.net/) for 1 months

- In the last `2 years` I have participated in more than `300 events`. That means I was at an event every one out of every two days. I love my sector.
